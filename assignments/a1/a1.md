Assignment 1 (10 Points)
------------

This is the first assignment of the course!
There are two parts of this assignment.

1. First create a static website hosted in Amazon using S3.  You
   can look at [the
   tutorial](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html)
   to get started with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and S3 in particular.
   
   Your website should serve a file called `grading.html`.  Assuming your domain is `http://ec2-yourdomain-someip.com/`,
   the url `http://ec2-yourdomain-someip.com/grading.html` should be available.  The file should only contain your 
   netid ONLY, no html tags whatsoever.
   
   Checkout [this](https://typtop.info/grading.html) for an example.
   

2. Add your name, netid, and the url for your `grading.html` page to the course Github repo. Do this by editing the page
   README.md and submitting a pull request.  Add your name in the appropriate place (please keep names in alpha order 
   by last name) and using this formatting exactly:
   
   ```text
   [Your Name](people/your-name.md) - yn444 - [https://ec2-yourdomain-someip.com/grading.html](https://ec2-yourdomain-someip.com/grading.html) 
   ```

   Make sure the names are in alphabetical order. (It's a good exercise to get conflict and resolving it.)

This is the [grading script](grade_a1.sh) that will be used to grade the assignment. You can run it yourself to verify you will receive credit for the assignment:

```bash
$ bash grade_a1.sh <netid>
```  
   ### Things that may go wrong. 
   * Your pull request might conflict with others. So, either make sure your branch is uptodate 
   with [`CT-CS5356-Fall2017/cs5356`](https://github.com/CT-CS5356-Fall2017/cs5356/), or fix the conflict on GitHub.
   Please don't delete changes made by someone else in the process of merging, or your pull request (PR) will surely
   be rejected.  
  
   * The script is returning error while your url in browser runs fine. Ping us in Slack.
