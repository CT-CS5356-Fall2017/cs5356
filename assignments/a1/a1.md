Assignment 1
------------

This is the first assignment of the course!
There are two parts of this assignment.

1. First you need to create a static website hosted in Amazon S3.  You
   can look at [the
   tutorial](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html)
   to get started with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and S3 in particular.
   
   Let your domain be `http://ec2-yourdomain-someip.com/`. 
   Your website should serve a file called `grading.html` at the url `http://ec2-yourdomain-someip.com/grading.html`.
   The file should only contain your netid (no html tags).
   Checkout [this](https://typtop.info/grading.html) for an example.
   

2. Now, add your name, netid, and the url for your `grading.html` to the course Github repo. Edit the page
   README.md.  
   ```text
   [Your Name](people/your-name.md) - yn444 - [https://ec2-yourdomain-someip.com/grading.html](https://ec2-yourdomain-someip.com/grading.html) 
   ```


We have a little [grading script](grade_a1.sh) that we will be using to grade the assignment. You can run as follows:
```bash
$ bash grade_a1.sh <netid>
```
