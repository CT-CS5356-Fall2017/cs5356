Assignment 2: Building RESTful Endpoints and adding Continuous Integration
---------------------------------------------------------

This assignment is the first step towards building a functional backend for
the final project---building a receipt storage and indexing service. 

We will build a server which will provide a set of RESTful APIs. If you are wondering what is 
REST, Wikipedia definition of REST is as follows.
> Representational state transfer (REST) or RESTful web services is a way of providing interoperability between computer systems on the Internet.

(Source Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)

The goal of this assignment is to give you a flavour of REST architecture, and, therefore, 
we will not worry about errands such as session management and access control---an user can read / write any receipt. 

Otherwise, at the very minimal, your server must provide the following set of APIs. 

(Here, `@something` denotes a value of a variable. The type of the variable should be
clear from the context.)

Every receipt in your database should have a unique receipt id, which will be used to fetch, modify, or delete the
receipt. A recipt may also contain vendor name, place, date of upload, and one or more tags seperated by ';'.
<!-- and a blob of text extracted from the receipt image. You do not have to store the image for the purpose of these APIs,
but might be useful to work with Vision API. (I haven't tried, so please educate me.) -->

0. `GET /`
    Setup a Github repo containing your code for this assignment, and connect it with a continuous 
    integratio service [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/). (Please dont' use something else, I will have hardtime parsing
    it.) You have to put a [CircleCI badge](https://circleci.com/docs/1.0/status-badges/) for your repo, which shows the
    status of your repo. We will check the existance of your badge in the `README.md` file on the top level directory of
    your repo. (I am talking about `master` branch.) 
    To obtain the link to your github repo, we will use the `GET /` API. (I know it looks like a dirty hack, but I think
    its a good one. :))
<!-- 1. `POST /user` body `username=@x&password=@y`  
    Registers a user with username `@x` and password `@y`. If a user already
    exists with the same username, the system should throw an error.  
    Returns 200 for success, and 400 for Failure. -->
1. `POST /receipt` body `vendor=@vendor&name=@name&place=@place`
    Craetes a new receipt in the database with the vendor `@vendor`, name `@name`, and place `@place`, and returns
    the receipt id of the newly created receipt resource in your database. 
    
    <!-- the submitted receipt image, name, tags (if any) in the db, and 
    runs optical character recognition (OCR) on the image using [Google Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/).
    This call to OCR API should be asynchronous, and the `POST /receipt` call should return a receipt id `@receiptid` 
    immediately.  One can fetch the OCR output later using `GET /receipt/@receiptid`. -->
2. `GET /receipt`  
   Returns an ordered list of receiptids stored so far in json format.
3. `PUT /receipt/@receiptid/tags` body `tags=@tags`
   Adds tags to a receipt with id `@receiptid`. You can have the API `GET /receipt/@receiptid/tags` to see the tags of
   a receipt, but its not mandatory.
   Returns success (200) or failure (400). Similarly you might as well create `PUT` ad `GET` APIS on the end-point
   `/receipt/@receipt/name`, and `.../vendor`. 
<!--3. `PUT /receipt/@receiptid/tags` body `tags=@tags`  (All parameters might not be specified.) 
   Same as the 1, but this time an existing receipt is updated as opposed to creating
   a new one.  Returns success (200) or failure (400).-->
4. `GET /receipt/@receiptid`  
  Returns (all) the details of a receipt with receipt id `@receiptid` in json format. 
  <!--If the OCR output is not yet available, 
  you should indicate that in the OCR field.-->
5. `DELETE /receipt/@receiptid`
   Deletes the receipt from the datbase.

The server should return error (400 or 404) on unspecified API call, or wrong receipt id for put and get requests.
Bonus points if your error code is consistent with HTTP Error codes, and give resonably detailed message 
regarding the error. (Don't reveal internals of your server!)


You can use the script [`grade_a2.py`]  to test your server. (Working on it)



### Some resources on REST
I will post here if I find any interesting articles / resources on RESTful architecture.
