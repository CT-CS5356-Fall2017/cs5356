Assignment 3: Build a Single Page Application (30 Points)
---
*Due Tuesday Sep 19th at midnight*

This assignment is the first step towards building a functional application for receipt
tracking and cataloging service.  The goal of this assignment
is to build a working HTML, CSS + Java Script single-page application that uses the
REST server you built in the last homework.

You will need to write and test the application, and ultimately deploy the application
to the cloud.

No additional PR's are necessary unless you change your server url.

To complete the assignment you must complete the following:
1. Build a SPA (Single Page Application that conforms to the UI Spec
2. Integrate your SPA into your Server
3. Deploy the API to AWS

*Important: Modern browser security restricts scripts running on particular
domains to that domain only.  If you are developing and encounter errors
regarding Mixed Media or Same-origin policy, you can cautiously consider
disabling security in your browser for development purposes.  To do this on OSX,
you must quit Chrome completely and then start Chrome from the command-line with special flags:*
```
 /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --allow-running-insecure-content --args --disable-web-security --user-data-dir
```

## 1. Building the SPA
Your assignment is to create a Single-Page Application that uses the API you
created in Assignment A2 to store and retrieve receipts.

For your assignment to be grade-able, you must follow specific conventions outlined
in this document with respect to the structure of HTML and the use of class attributes in specific locations.

Beyond these simple constraints, you are free to style and compose your application as you see fit:

#### Initial Sate
![](is.png)

When your application opens, your application should query and display all receipts in the database.  Fields for Time, Merchant, Amount and tags are required.

1. Every receipt must be represented by a single element of the form `<DIV class="receipt">...</DIV>`.  The receipt elemen
t may have any internal structure you desire.  Receipts must be selectable using `$('.receipt')`

2. Every receipt must have the following fields available: `merchant`, `amount` and `tags`.
   * The merchant must be selectable using the following JQuery selector: `$('.merchant', $('.receipt')[0]).text()`
   * The amount must be selectable using the following JQuery selector: `$('.amount', $('.receipt')[0]).text()`

#### Add New Receipt
![](ar.png)

Clicking on the ‘add receipt’ button should add a receipt-entry node to the DOM that allows the user to enter a new receipt with merchant (required) and amount (optional) values.  Hitting ‘save’ will POST to the `/receipts` endpoint of your API.  Hitting `cancel` will close the form and discard any values entered.  Errors from the server should appear somewhere in the receipt-entry node so the user can understand and correct any problems.

1. The add button for receipts MUST have id ‘add-receipt’ and be selectable via `$(‘#add-receipt’)`.  A `click` event
fired on the element should show the add-receipt dialogue.

2. You must use `INPUT` elements for the ‘merchant’ and ‘amount’ entry, and the `INPUT` elements must have id's `#merchant` and `#entry`.

3. The save and cancel button must have ids `save-receipt` and `cancel-receipt` and respond to `click` events.


#### Add Tags to Existing Receipts
![](at.png)

The application supports the tagging of receipts with arbitrary user-defined tags.

* Every receipt row must have a button with class `add-tag` that responds to `click` events.  When clicked, an `INPUT` element with class `tag_input` must be added to the DOM **as a child of the receipt row upon which add-tag was clicked** and should be selectable by JQuery using `$('INPUT.tag_input', receiptNode)`.  The input element should execute a `PUT` request against your API when the user strikes the `Enter` key in the `INPUT` element.

* The result of a successful `PUT` operation is the removal of the `tag_input` element from the dom, and the addition of an element displaying the name of the tag now associated with the receipt.

* Tag elements must have a `tagValue` class attribute and the value of the tags for a particular receipt must be selectable via e.g. `$('.tagValue', receiptNode)[0].text()`

* Tag elements must respond to `click` events which execute a `PUT` request against your API to dissociate the receipt from the tag that was clicked.

## 2. Integrate the SPA into yor Server
Adam will provide a snippet of code to support you in this regard

## 3. Deploy to AWS
Exactly the same as we did in Assignment 02.
