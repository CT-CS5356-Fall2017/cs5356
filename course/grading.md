### Grading

Course grading is based only completion and sophistication of the course project.

Points are earned through building the systems required to support the class project.  You will work as a team, however the points you earn as an individual are determined by the product of the *points for the work* x *your understanding of the work*.  Points for the work and your understanding for the work will be judged in an in-person interview taking ~20 mins during finals week, by class staff.

There are 4 buckets you can earn points in, based on the *sophistication*, *quality* and *your understanding* of the work.

The buckets are:

1. *Mobile Client* written in Ionic or ReactJS Native
2. *API* in any language you like
3. *Storage + Processing* (e.g. Database, Storage, Thumbnail Processing, etc)
4. *DevOps* (e.g. Continuous Integration, Deployment, Logging and Monitoring)

You can earn up to 3 points per bucket per project.

* 1 point for a working basic system, aka a "Hello World"
* 2 points for achieving a level of proficiency
* 3 points for demonstrating advanced capabilities
