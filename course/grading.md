### Grading

Course grading is based only completion and sophistication of the course project.

Points are earned through building the systems required to support the class project.  You will work as a team, however the points you earn as an individual are determined by the product of the *points for the work* x *your understanding of the work*.  Points for the work and your understanding for the work will be judged in an in-person interview taking ~20 mins during finals week, by class staff.

There are 4 buckets you can earn points in, based on the *sophistication*, *quality* and *your understanding* of the work.

The buckets are:

1. *Mobile Client* 
2. *API* 
3. *Database* 
4. *DevOps* 

You can earn a number of points per bucket per project based on your accomplishments 
in that domain.
